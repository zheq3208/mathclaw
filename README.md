## ✨ What is ResearchClaw?

ResearchClaw is an AI research assistant that runs on **your own machine**. Built on the [AgentScope](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) framework, it uses a ReAct agent with specialized research tools to help you:

- 📄 **Search & discover papers** — ArXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar
- 📚 **Manage references** — BibTeX import/export, citation graph exploration
- 🔍 **Read & summarize papers** — Extract key findings from PDFs
- 📊 **Analyze data** — Statistical analysis, visualization, experiment tracking
- ✍️ **Write & review** — LaTeX assistance, literature review generation
- ⏰ **Stay updated** — Daily paper digests, deadline reminders, citation alerts
- 🧠 **Build knowledge** — Persistent research notes and memory across sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run this in the repository root directory.

### Initialize

```bash
researchclaw init --defaults --accept-security
```

This sets up your working directory (`~/.researchclaw`) and configures your LLM provider.

### Launch

```bash
researchclaw app
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8088/](http://127.0.0.1:8088/) in your browser.

### Frontend (Console) Development

Run backend first:

```bash
researchclaw app
```

In another terminal, start the frontend dev server:

```bash
cd console
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the Vite URL (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)).
The frontend dev server proxies `/api` requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8088`.

To build production frontend assets:

```bash
cd console
npm run build
```

`console/dist` will be served automatically by the backend when available.

### One-liner Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://researchclaw.github.io/install.sh | bash
```

- **figure_generator** — Create publication-ready figures
- **research_notes** — Structured note-taking with tagging
- **pdf** — Advanced PDF processing and annotation

## ⚙️ Configuration

ResearchClaw stores all data locally in `~/.researchclaw/`:

```
~/.researchclaw/
├── config.json          # Main configuration
├── .env                 # API keys and environment variables
├── jobs.json            # Scheduled tasks (paper digests, reminders)
├── chats.json           # Conversation history
├── active_skills/       # Currently active skills
├── customized_skills/   # Your custom skills
├── memory/              # Research notes and knowledge base
├── papers/              # Downloaded papers cache
├── references/          # BibTeX library
└── experiments/         # Experiment tracking data
```

### LLM Provider Setup

ResearchClaw supports multiple LLM providers:

```bash
# Set up with OpenAI
researchclaw env set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Or Anthropic
researchclaw env set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Or use local models via Ollama
researchclaw providers add ollama
```

## 🤖 Agent Commands

In the chat interface, use these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/compact` | Compress conversation memory |
| `/clear` | Clear all history |
| `/history` | Show conversation statistics |
| `/papers` | List recently discussed papers |
| `/refs` | Show current reference library |

## 📋 CLI Reference

```bash
researchclaw init          # Interactive setup wizard
researchclaw app           # Start the web server
researchclaw papers search # Search for papers from CLI
researchclaw papers list   # List saved papers
researchclaw skills list   # List available skills
researchclaw skills add    # Install a skill from the hub
researchclaw env list      # List environment variables
researchclaw providers     # Manage LLM providers
researchclaw cron          # Manage scheduled tasks
```

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **All data stays local** — your papers, notes, and API keys never leave your machine
- **No telemetry** — ResearchClaw does not collect usage data
- **You control the LLM** — choose your provider, use local models for sensitive research
