# Contributing to ResearchClaw

## Welcome! 🔬

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ResearchClaw! ResearchClaw is an open-source **AI research assistant** that runs in your own environment—on your machine or in the cloud. It helps researchers track papers, manage references, log experiments, and analyze data. It connects to DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Discord, iMessage, and other chat apps, supports scheduled tasks and heartbeat, and extends its capabilities through **Skills**. We warmly welcome contributions that help make ResearchClaw more useful for everyone: whether you add a new channel, a new model provider, a Skill, improve docs, or fix bugs.

## How to Contribute

To keep collaboration smooth and maintain quality, please follow these guidelines.

### 1. Check Existing Plans and Issues

Before starting:

- **Check [Open Issues](https://github.com/MingxinYang/ResearchClaw/issues)** and any [Projects](https://github.com/MingxinYang/ResearchClaw/projects) or roadmap labels.
- **If a related issue exists** and is open or unassigned: comment to say you want to work on it to avoid duplicate effort.
- **If no related issue exists**: open a new issue describing your proposal. The maintainers will respond and can help align with the project direction.

### 2. Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for clear history and tooling.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Code style (whitespace, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Build, tooling, or maintenance

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(channels): add Telegram channel stub
fix(skills): correct SKILL.md front matter parsing
docs(readme): update quick start for Docker
refactor(providers): simplify custom provider validation
test(agents): add tests for skill loading
```

### 3. Pull Request Title Format

PR titles should follow the same convention:

**Format:** ` <type>(<scope>): <description> `

- Use one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, `revert`.
- **Scope must be lowercase** (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores only).
- Keep the description short and descriptive.

**Examples:**
```
feat(models): add custom provider for Azure OpenAI
fix(channels): handle empty content_parts in Discord
docs(skills): document Skills Hub import
```

### 4. Code and Quality

- **Pre-commit:** Install and run pre-commit for consistent style and checks:
  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[dev]"
  pre-commit install
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```
- **Tests:** Run tests before submitting:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Frontend formatting:** If your changes involve the `console` or `website` directories, run the formatter before committing:
  ```bash
  cd console && npm run format
  cd website && npm run format
  ```
- **Documentation:** Update docs and README when you add or change user-facing behavior. The docs live under `website/public/docs/`.

## Types of Contributions

ResearchClaw is designed to be **extensible**: you can add models, channels, Skills, and more. Below are the main contribution areas we care about.

---

### Adding New Models / Model Providers

ResearchClaw supports **multiple model backends**: cloud APIs (e.g. DashScope, ModelScope), **Ollama**, and local backends (**llama.cpp**, **MLX**). You can contribute in two ways:

#### A. Custom provider (user configuration)

Users can add **custom providers** via the Console or `providers.json`: any OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. vLLM, SGLang, private endpoints) can be configured with a unique ID, base URL, API key, and optional model list. No code change is required for standard OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### B. New built-in provider or new ChatModel (code contribution)

If you want to add a **new built-in provider** or a **new API protocol** that is not OpenAI-compatible:

1. **Provider definition** (in `src/researchclaw/providers/registry.py` or equivalent):
   - Add a `ProviderDefinition` with `id`, `name`, `default_base_url`, `api_key_prefix`, and optionally `models` and `chat_model`.
   - For local/self-hosted backends, set `is_local` as appropriate.

2. **Chat model class** (if the API is not OpenAI-compatible):
   - Implement a class inheriting from the appropriate base model wrapper.
   - Support streaming and non-streaming if the agent uses both; respect `tool_choice` and tools API if used.
   - Register the class in the registry's chat model map so the runtime can resolve it by name (see `_CHAT_MODEL_MAP` in `src/researchclaw/providers/registry.py`).

3. **Documentation:** Document the new provider or model in the docs (e.g. under a "Models" or "Providers" section) and mention any env vars or config keys.

Adding a fully new API (new message format, token counting, tools) is a larger change; we recommend opening an issue first to discuss scope and design.

---

### Adding New Channels

Channels are how ResearchClaw talks to **DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Discord, iMessage**, etc. You can add a new channel so ResearchClaw can work with your favorite IM or bot platform.

- **Protocol:** All channels use a unified in-process contract: **native payload → `content_parts`** (e.g. `TextContent`, `ImageContent`, `FileContent`). The agent receives `AgentRequest` with these content parts; replies are sent back via the channel's send path.
- **Implementation:** Implement a **subclass of `BaseChannel`** (in `src/researchclaw/app/channels/base.py`):
  - Set the class attribute `channel` to a unique channel key (e.g. `"telegram"`).
  - Implement the lifecycle and message handling (e.g. receive → `content_parts` → `process` → send response).
  - Use the manager's queue and consumer loop if the channel is long-lived (default).
- **Discovery:** Built-in channels are registered in `src/researchclaw/app/channels/registry.py`. **Custom channels** are loaded from the working directory: place a module (e.g. `custom_channels/telegram.py` or a package `custom_channels/telegram/`) that defines a `BaseChannel` subclass with a `channel` attribute.
- **CLI:** Users install/add channels with:
  - `researchclaw channels install <key>` — create a template or copy from `--path` / `--url`
  - `researchclaw channels add <key>` — install and add to config
  - `researchclaw channels remove <key>` — remove custom channel from `custom_channels/`
  - `researchclaw channels config` — interactive config

If you contribute a **new built-in channel**, add it to the registry and, if needed, a configurator so it appears in the Console and CLI. Document the new channel (auth, webhooks, etc.) in `website/public/docs/channels.*.md`.

---

### Adding Base Skills

**Skills** define what ResearchClaw can do: cron, file reading, PDF/Office, paper search, reference management, etc. We welcome **broadly useful** base skills (research, productivity, documents, communication, automation) that fit the majority of users.

- **Structure:** Each skill is a **directory** containing:
  - **`SKILL.md`** — Markdown instructions for the agent. Use YAML front matter for at least `name` and `description`; optional `metadata` (e.g. for Console).
  - **`references/`** (optional) — Reference documents the agent can use.
  - **`scripts/`** (optional) — Scripts or tools the skill uses.
- **Location:** Built-in skills live under `src/researchclaw/agents/skills/<skill_name>/`. The app merges built-in and user **customized_skills** from the working dir into **active_skills**; no extra registration is needed beyond placing a valid `SKILL.md` in a directory.
- **Content:** Write clear, task-oriented instructions. Describe **when** the skill should be used and **how** (steps, commands, file formats). Avoid overly niche or personal workflows if targeting the **base** repository; those are great as custom or community Skills.

#### Writing Effective Skill Descriptions

To help the model accurately recognize and invoke your skill, the `description` field in your SKILL.md front matter must be **clear, specific, and include trigger keywords**. Follow these best practices:

**✅ Recommended format:**
```yaml
---
name: example_skill
description: "Use this skill whenever user wants to [main functionality]. Trigger especially when user mentions: [trigger keywords]. Also use when [other scenarios]."

# Detailed instructions below
...
```

**✅ Best practices:**
1. **Clearly state when to trigger**: Use phrases like "Use this skill whenever user wants to..." or "Trigger when user asks for..."
2. **List trigger keywords explicitly**: Make it easy for the model to recognize, for example:
   - "Trigger especially when user mentions: \"paper\", \"arxiv\", \"search papers\", \"literature\""
   - "Also trigger for reference management tasks like BibTeX, citations"
3. **Be specific about the skill's scope**: Say exactly what it does, avoid vague terms
   - ✅ Good: "Search and track academic papers from ArXiv and Semantic Scholar"
   - ❌ Not ideal: "Search things"
4. **Provide usage examples**: If the skill has specific usage patterns, explain them in the body of SKILL.md

**❌ Common pitfalls:**
- Overly abstract descriptions (like "search things", "process files")
- Missing trigger keywords, making it hard for the model to identify use cases
- Lack of usage scenario context

**📝 Examples comparison:**

| Skill | Description (Not ideal) | Description (Better) |
|-------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Paper Search | "Search papers" | "Use this skill whenever user wants to search academic papers or track new publications. Trigger especially when user mentions: \"paper\", \"arxiv\", \"publication\", \"search papers\", or requests for literature review." |
| File Reader | "Read files" | "Use this skill when user asks to read or summarize local text-based files. PDFs, Office documents, images are out of scope." |

Examples of in-repo base skills: **cron**, **file_reader**, **news**, **pdf**, **docx**, **pptx**, **xlsx**, **browser_visible**. Contributing a new base skill usually means: add the directory under `agents/skills/`, add a short entry in the docs (e.g. Skills table in `website/public/docs/skills.*.md`), and ensure it syncs correctly to the working directory.

### Platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)

ResearchClaw aims to run on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Contributions that improve support on a specific platform are welcome.

- **Compatibility fixes:** Path handling, line endings, shell commands, or dependencies that behave differently per OS.
- **Install and run:** One-line install (`install.sh`), `pip` install, and `researchclaw init` / `researchclaw app` should work (or be clearly documented) on each supported platform.
- **Platform-specific features:** Optional integrations are fine as long as they don't break other platforms. Use runtime checks or optional dependencies where appropriate.
- **Documentation:** Document any platform-specific steps, known limitations, or recommended setups in the docs or README.

If you add or change platform support, please test on the affected OS and mention it in the PR description.

---

### Other Contributions

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** ResearchClaw supports runtime **MCP tool** discovery and hot-plug. Contributing new MCP servers or tools (or docs on how to attach them) helps users extend the agent without changing core code.
- **Documentation:** Fixes and improvements to the docs (under `website/public/docs/`) and README are always welcome.
- **Bug fixes and refactors:** Small fixes, clearer error messages, and refactors that keep behavior the same are valuable. Prefer opening an issue for larger refactors so we can align on approach.
- **Examples and workflows:** Tutorials or example workflows (e.g. "daily paper digest to DingTalk", "local model + cron") can be documented or linked from the repo/docs.
- **Any other useful things!**
