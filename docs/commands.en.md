# Commands

ResearchClaw supports commands in chat to control system behavior.

## Available Commands

| Command             | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`             | Show help information                        |
| `/compact`          | Manually trigger conversation compression    |
| `/clear`            | Clear current session's conversation history |
| `/reset`            | Reset assistant state                        |
| `/skills`           | List installed skills                        |
| `/install <url>`    | Install a skill from GitHub                  |
| `/uninstall <name>` | Uninstall a skill                            |

## Usage

In any channel's chat, type a command starting with `/`:

```
/help
```

```
/install https://github.com/user/my-skill
```

## Commands vs. Natural Language

Besides commands, you can also describe your needs in natural language, and the AI assistant will understand and perform the corresponding action:

```
Install this skill: https://github.com/user/my-skill
```

This is equivalent to `/install https://github.com/user/my-skill`.
